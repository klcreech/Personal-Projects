<h1>Responsive Design Project - SynApps</h1><br>
 <p>In an effort to manually code a responsive design that is cross browser compatible I felt it would be good practice to code it from scratch. All the images were created in GIMP. this was just a basic color scheme and simple design, the main focus was responsiveness and cross browser compatabilty. I learned a valuable lesson by doing this project. SCSS helps so you don't have 2000 lines of CSS trying this.</p><br<br>
