<h1>Canvas App Project Project - BioSine</h1><br>
 <p>In an effort to take a trigonometric equation and convert it into a interactive app I decided to create one using canvas and its abilities to animate. All the images were created in GIMP. I learned alot about how canvas works and also how the animation.js construct works. This also helped with my knowledge of JQuery.</p><br<br>
